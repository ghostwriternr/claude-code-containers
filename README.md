# 🐳 Containers Starter

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ghostwriternr/claude-code-containers)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

This is a [Container](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/) starter template. 📦

It demonstrates basic Container configuration, launching and routing to individual container, load balancing over multiple container, running basic hooks on container status changes. ⚡

<!-- dash-content-end -->

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI): 🚀

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=ghostwriternr/claude-code-containers
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then run the development server (using the package manager of your choice):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) with your browser to see the result. 🌐

You can start editing your Worker by modifying `src/index.ts` and you can start
editing your Container by editing the content of `container_src`. ✏️
